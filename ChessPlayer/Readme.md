# ChessPlayer
A Game of chess that will be able to be played against a computer or against a human opponent.

I gave myself 3 hours to work on this to see how much I could do in the short timespan and this initial commit is what came out of that.
I plan on getting back to this when I have some free time to flesh out some stuff and make it in to a complete project but I'm decently proud of it as is.

### Features
- You can indeed play chess against a human opponent (Or against yourself), but both players need to have a decent knowledge of the game in order to play.

### Need to do
##### Important to completing the project
- Add graphics for the pieces! Right now they are just a textbox saying what they are
- Add checking for check as well as checkmate. The game doesn't know when to end as is.
- A few possible moves have been neglected (en passant and castling, to be specific) because in the moment I didn't think of them.

##### Things I'd like to add after finishing the important stuff
- A GUI, including an undo button, a timer, and an indicator of who's turn it is
- The option to play against a computer of variable difficulty (I built the basics of a decision tree, I just didn't implement computer control or decision making strategies yet)
- If I'm really feeling it: the option to play against a human through a network.
