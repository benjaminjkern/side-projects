# Python Projects

## POMDPs
I did research during my time at LMU with Dr. Andrew Forney in the field of Causal relations in AI. This is the repo of all the code I wrote for that.
When I find the poster I made for it, I'll put that in there too.

## wordMaker.py
I made this originally as a way of generating NPC names for a game I was making based on a collection of preexisting names. I wanted it to be able to generate a real sounding name that fits nicely into the dataset given, but not necessarily be a real name.
If I gave it a set of Japanese names, it should be able to make a realistic-sounding Japanese name. This program does this, but I found out quickly that it actually works remarkably well on strings longer than just names.
I gave it several scripts of movies, or sample personal text conversations, and it generated interesting results! (Note: This is nothing like GPT-2 or GPT-3, it's hardly using any "AI" at all)
The results that this gives are usually grammatically correct or at least sound like they could be real sentences, but they are complete gibberish, which I think is really funny.

## posterize.py
This is a fun program that I used for the [Cuttlefish Programming Language]() logo, it basically just filters an input image such that every color is mapped to the closest color out of a set of input colors. It creates a neat effect.
