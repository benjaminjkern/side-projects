# Neural Nets
~By Ben Kern~
Small API for plugging NeuralNets in to games, included so far is a simple bot fighting game. They evolve and learn to fight each other better with each generation

### Usage
Run "Main" file to run program
- [SPACE] : Toggle sped up simulation
- [A] : Toggle stats screen
- [W/S] : Switch what is showing on stats screen
- [P] : Toggle pause simulation


### To Do List
##### Specifics
- Explain what each stats screen chart is displaying
- Add ability to see Nets at work
- Add settings that aren't set within the code
  - Change NeuralNets' hyperparameters as well as the population parameters
- Add ability for human to take control of bot and fight a trained bot

##### Bigger picture/bigger projects to do's
- Implement other games and flesh out the easiness of being able to plug in control over those games
  - I would probably do Chess since that's another project I have
  - Other options include a racing game, a top down tank game that I haven't fully made yet
- Big one: Formulate a "quasi-machine learning" algorithm that allows for the neural nets to learn faster than random evolution, I realize this is something that hasn't been solved yet but I can take a stab at it.
