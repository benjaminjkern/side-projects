# Cellular Automata
*By Ben Kern*

## Info
This used to be just John Conway's Game of Life, but instead I turned it into a general cellular automat program. Each time you run the simulation, it creates a random ruleset for the cellular automata and lets it run. It's pretty cool.

## What's new
- General 2-dimensional Cellular Automata simulator as opposed to just the Game of Life
- It uses an animation API That I made, which from the outside doesnt really do much but it's easier on the coding aspect. I've been doing a lot of this recently.

### Usage
- Click a pixel to change its state
- Drag with mouse down to draw
- Mouse out of screen to run simulation

### To do List
- Add more user settings! (So that it's not locked and can actually accurately show how this concept works)
  - Different colors
  - Add scalability (Ability to zoom in and out and adjust pixels in screen)
  - Add border interaction options
    - Wrap, set to 0, set to 1, copy closest, etc.
- Clean up code
