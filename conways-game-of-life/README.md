# John Conway's Game of Life
*By Ben Kern*

## Info
If you are for some reason unfamiliar with Conway's Game of Life, here's a neat link that explains it infinitely better than I ever could:
[WIKIPEDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Right now the 

### Usage
- Click a pixel to change its state
- Mouse out of screen to run simulation

### To do List
- Add more user settings! (So that it's not locked and can actually accurately show how this concept works)
  - Different colors
  - Add scalability (Ability to zoom in and out and adjust pixels in screen)
  - Add border interaction options
    - Wrap, set to 0, set to 1, copy closest, etc.
- *Big one that I actually will definitely do when I get time to do it*: Turn this in to a general form of cellular automata program, with user able to set the specific rules. Here's another link that will explain what these are, again better than I could:
