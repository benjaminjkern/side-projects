# Lambda
This is a fully implemented Lambda Calculus Programming Language. Immediately after finishing this, I went and made [Lambda++](https://github.com/benjaminjkern/side-projects/blob/master/js-projects/lambda%2B%2B), which is actually a really cool project that I might end up elevating from the status of just "side project".
